Welcome! I'm a Graduate Trainee on an exciting journey into the world of system administration. I'm currently immersed in an apprenticeship where I get my hands dirty with Linux and unravel the complexities of network fundamentals daily. There's nothing I enjoy more than solving a tricky configuration problem or watching a network topology come together.

Alongside my sysadmin focus, I wield Python as a powerful tool to automate tasks and build practical solutions. I believe in the power of scripting to make systems more efficient and reliable.

  This portfolio documents my learning progress and projects. I'm eager to connect, learn from experienced professionals, and find a role where I can contribute my growing skills and enthusiasm.
